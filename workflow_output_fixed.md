--- Interaction 1 ---
 Step 1: Worker agent generates a response to the prompt
Prompt:
To compile a comprehensive development plan, follow these steps:

1. Gather all User Stories:
   - Collect every user story that defines the desired functionality from the product backlog.

2. Identify Features:
   - Group related user stories into features that represent larger functional areas or capabilities.

3. Define Development Tasks:
   - For each user story, identify the specific development tasks required to implement it.
   - Tasks should be clear, actionable, and detailed enough for developers to execute.

4. Organize the Plan:
   - Structure the plan by features, listing the associated user stories under each feature.
   - Under each user story, list the development tasks needed.

5. Prioritize and Schedule:
   - Assign priorities to features, stories, and tasks based on business value and dependencies.
   - Create a timeline or sprint plan to schedule the tasks accordingly.

This approach ensures that the development plan comprehensively covers what needs to be built, organized logically, and ready for execution.
Worker Agent Response:
Understood. To define development tasks for a product, the key step is to identify what needs to be built to implement each user story. This means:

- For every user story collected from the product backlog, analyze the functionality it describes.
- Break down the user story into specific, actionable development tasks that developers can execute.
- Ensure tasks are detailed and clear, directly tied to fulfilling the user storyÆs requirements.

By focusing on this, you create a solid foundation for the development plan, enabling logical organization by features and user stories, and facilitating prioritization and scheduling.
 Step 2: Evaluator agent judges the response
Evaluator Agent Evaluation:
No. 

The provided answer explains the general approach to defining development tasks but does not follow the exact structure required. It lacks specific elements such as Task ID, Task Title, Related User Story, Description, Acceptance Criteria, Estimated Effort, and Dependencies for each task. Instead, it describes the process at a high level without detailing individual tasks in the specified format.
 Step 3: Check if evaluation is positive
 Step 4: Generate instructions to correct the response
Instructions to fix:
To fix the answer, follow these instructions:

1. **Use the Required Structure for Each Task:**  
   For every development task, include the following elements explicitly and clearly:  
   - **Task ID:** A unique identifier for the task (e.g., T1, T2).  
   - **Task Title:** A concise title summarizing the task.  
   - **Related User Story:** Reference the user story that this task supports.  
   - **Description:** A detailed explanation of what the task involves.  
   - **Acceptance Criteria:** Specific conditions that must be met for the task to be considered complete.  
   - **Estimated Effort:** An estimate of the time or complexity (e.g., in hours or story points).  
   - **Dependencies:** Any tasks or conditions that must be completed before this task can start.

2. **Detail Individual Tasks Instead of General Process:**  
   Instead of describing the overall approach or methodology, break down the work into discrete, actionable tasks following the structure above.

3. **Ensure Completeness and Clarity:**  
   Each task should be self-contained and provide enough information for a developer or team member to understand what needs to be done and how to verify completion.

4. **Example Format:**  
   ```
   Task ID: T1  
   Task Title: Implement User Login API  
   Related User Story: US1 - User Authentication  
   Description: Develop the backend API to handle user login requests, including validation and token generation.  
   Acceptance Criteria:  
     - API accepts valid credentials and returns an authentication token.  
     - API rejects invalid credentials with appropriate error messages.  
   Estimated Effort: 8 hours  
   Dependencies: Database schema for users must be finalized (T0).
   ```

By restructuring your answer to include these detailed, formatted tasks, you will meet the specified requirements and provide a clear, actionable plan.
